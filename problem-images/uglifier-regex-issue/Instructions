Issue

The issue is that when uglifying a certain regex an extra backslash is added in the uglified output. For this example the original and uglified outputs are as follows:

original: function boomBaby(s) { return s.split(/[\\/]/); };
uglified: function boomBaby(n){return n.split(/[\\\/]/)}

There is an extra backslash added in the uglified output. From what I can tell both the original and uglified regexes appear to perform the same, but this can cause problems with output that is verified with a hash as the extra backslash will cause the hash of the output not to match the expected hash.

Steps to Reproduce

To reproduce the issue first build the docker file by running the following in a directory containing all files in this current folder:

docker build -f uglifier_problem.dockerfile . -t uglifier

To run a container that will create the problem output run:

docker run -it --rm uglifier

The problem output can be seen in /tmp/gulp_problem/uglifierOutput/simple_regex.js inside the container
